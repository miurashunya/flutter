The rendering library exposes a central widget called `AnimatedDrawing` which allows to render SVG paths (via `AnimatedDrawing.svg`) or Flutter Path objects (via `AnimatedDrawing.paths`) in a drawing like fashion.

## Getting Started  - AnimatedDrawing.svg
To get started with the `drawing_animation` package you need a valid Svg file.
Currently only simple path elements without transforms are supported (see [Supported SVG specifications](https://github.com/biocarl/drawing_animation#supported-svg-specifications))

1. **Add dependency in your `pubspec.yaml`**
```yaml
dependencies:
  drawing_animation: ^1.0.0

```

2. **Add the SVG asset**
```yaml
assets:
  - assets/my_drawing.svg
```
3. **Use the widget**

    An AnimatedDrawing widget can be initiated in two ways:
    1. **Simplified - without animation controller (See [Example_01](https://github.com/biocarl/drawing_animation/tree/master/example/example_01))**

        By default every animation repeats infinitely. For running an animation only once you can use a callback to set `run` to false after the first animation cycle completed (see field `onFinish`).
        ```dart
        AnimatedDrawing.svg(
          "assets/my_drawing.svg",
          run: this.run,
          duration: new Duration(seconds: 3),
          onFinish: () => setState(() {
            this.run  = false;
          }),
        )
        ```

    2. **Standard - with animation controller (See [Example_02](https://github.com/biocarl/drawing_animation/tree/master/example/example_02))**

        The simplified version will be sufficient in most of the use cases. If you wish to controll the animation furthermore or you want to syncronize it with other existing animations, you might consider using an custom [animation controller](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/animation/AnimationController-class.html):
        ```dart
        AnimatedDrawing.svg(
          "assets/test.svg",
          controller: this.controller,
        )
        ```

4. Check out examples in the `examples` folder. It seems that antialising for the Paint/Canvas is switched off when using debug mode. For pretty results use `flutter run --release`.

## Getting Started  - AnimatedDrawing.paths (still experimental)
By providing Path objects directly to the widget, elements can be changed dynamically, even during the animation. The internal data structure is rebuild every time the state changes, therefore the animation performance might suffer if the amount of elements in `paths` is very high (see Limitations). More examples will be provided soon (for now see [Example_01](https://github.com/biocarl/drawing_animation/tree/master/example/example_01) and [Example_04](https://github.com/biocarl/drawing_animation/tree/master/example/example_04)).

  ```dart
  AnimatedDrawing.paths(
      [
      ///Path objects
      ],
      paints:[
      ///Paint objects (optional), specifies a [Paint] object for each [Path] element in `paths`.
      ],
      run: this.run,
      duration: new Duration(seconds: 3),
      onFinish: () => setState(() {
        this.run  = false;
      }),
    )
  ```
**Current limitations:**

As stated, for every state change of the widget, the internal data structure for the path objects is rebuilt. When the amount of provided path objects is high and a custom `animationOrder` is defined (which triggers a sorting operation over the data structure) it can result in lags. This becomes especially apparent when the state is rebuild at 60fps by another animation (e.g. rotating the path objects at every frame). Any suggestions on how to elegantly solve this are very welcome :-)
